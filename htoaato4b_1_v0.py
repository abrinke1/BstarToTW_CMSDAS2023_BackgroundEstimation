    '''Used by the Ledger.select() method to create a subset of a Ledger.
    This function provides the logic to determine which entries/rows of the Ledger
    to keep for the subset. The first argument should always be the row to process.
    The arguments that follow will be the other arguments of Ledger.select().
    This function should ALWAYS return a bool that signals whether to keep (True)
    or drop (False) the row.

    To check if entries in the Ledger pass, we can access a given row's
    column value via attributes which are named after the columns (ex. row.process
    gets the "process" column). One can also access them as keys (ex. row["process"]).

    In this example, we want to select for signals that have a specific string
    in their name ("process"). Thus, the first element of `args` contains the string
    we want to find.

    We also want to pick a TF to use so the second element of `args` contains a
    string to specify the Background_args[1] process we want to use.

    Args:
        row (pandas.Series): The row to evaluate.
        args (list): Arguments to pass in for the evaluation.

    Returns:
        Bool: True if keeping the row, False if dropping.

    Some explanation for the following few lines of code: 
      We're nominally running on input histograms whose Pass/Fail criteria is based on a top tag using
      tau32 + subjet b tag (as opposed to DeepAK8 or ParticleNet taggers).
      Tau32 (and, to an extent, the subjet b tag) are very correlated with m_top and slightly correlated 
      with m_htoaato4b such that the pass-fail ratio is not smooth at all. The correlations are complicated enough
      that the pass-fail ratio has very strange but distinct features. These features are modeled very well by 
      the MC, so the idea is to use the MC to describe the majority of this, and the larger leftover disagreements
      can be made up by a simple polynomial (line 118).
